i started project 



I built a Playwright-based data scraper in VS Code and Jupyter to extract basketball, baseball, and football odds data from the HotStreak platform. Initially, I faced a “Python not found” error, which I fixed by reinstalling Python 3.11.9 and setting up a virtual environment. After installing Playwright and other dependencies, I encountered event loop errors because Jupyter and Playwright’s async system conflicted on Windows. I switched to the synchronous API, but that also failed inside Jupyter, so I moved the capture process to an external Python script, which successfully launched the browser and saved network data. When I first parsed the results, I got JSONDecodeErrors and “Parsed matches: 0” because the captured files didn’t contain valid game data. I implemented a safe loader to skip empty files and then built a more advanced script, capture_dump_all.py, to record every request, response, and WebSocket frame. Another error, “TargetClosedError,” occurred when I closed the browser too early, so I learned to let it stay open for the full capture duration. Now, my setup works correctly — data folders, environment, and Playwright are all functioning.
